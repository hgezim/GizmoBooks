This is a Django-based project I created for a business that did textbook buying and selling from students.

It was Canada-based. It calculated shipping costs for student's who were based in different city from the seller.

Quite a lot of work went into this. Please have a look. Email me if you have a project you need help with: hgezim [at] gmail.com
